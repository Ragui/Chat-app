# Chat-app
This is a chat application designed to connect people together. The app includes the client side and the server side. 
The client side consists of a sign up, log in, home, and chat pages. Each user needs to create an account first. Then, he/she can log in and go to the home page. In the home page, you can check your friends list, add new friends, search for friends, start a conversation with a friend, check your friend requests, update your settings, or log out. The chat page will allow you to have a conversation with a friend and you can go back to the home page when you are done. 
The server side is responsible for connecting different users. Any user request is sent to server which detects the type of request and send a response accordingly. The type of requests can be sign up, log in, check online friends, check my new messages, send a text to a friend, send a friend request, log out, and many more. 
The app is implemented in C using socket programming to connect the client and server, and GTK to implement the GUI.
